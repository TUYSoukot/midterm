        Subject: Request an adjustment to my salary <br><br>
        
        Mr. Pheng,<br><br>
        
        Thank you so much for the opportunities you’ve provided me during my time as a sales executive for ABC Company.<br> Over the past two years, I’ve grown significantly as a professional, deepened my understanding of the industry,<br> improved my skillset and taken on many new responsibilities. For these reasons, I would like to request an adjustment to my salary. <br><br>
        
        If possible, I would like to meet to discuss my request in person. I am happy to work with you to accommodate this request and am open to negotiation.<br> Please let me know when would be best to talk through further. <br>
        <br>
        Sincerely,<br><br>
        
        Tuy Soukot
